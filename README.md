# WGT-Altruism-Model-Code
Code used for the simulations that are reported in the submission to BMC Ecology and Evolution, "The role of the ecological scaffold in the origin and maintenance of whole-group trait altruism in microbial populations.", September 2022

Single_Population_Simulation.m - Simulates the macroevolutionary dynamics of a single microbial population in which cells can sometimes switch by mutation between A-type (whole-group trait altruist, produces a publicg good at a cost) S-type (selfish, does not produce the publicg good).
